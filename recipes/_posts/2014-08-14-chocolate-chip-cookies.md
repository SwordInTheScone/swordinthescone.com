Cream softened butter with a wooden spoon until it's smooth and a little
airy. Add the granulated sugar, brown sugar and salt. Pass the Muscovado sugar
through a fine sieve and add it to the bowl with butter and sugar. Cream
together the butter and sugar until well combined and very fluffy.

Add the vanilla and then the eggs, one at a time, beating until the batter
visibly lightens in color after each egg is added. Add 2 cups of flour and 1 tsp
baking soda. If the dough looks wet or the day is particularly humid, add
remaining &frac14; cup. If the dough holds together and is not too sticky, leave
the remaining flour out. Add chocolate chips and mix well. Place bowl in fridge
overnight.

Preheat oven to 375.

Using your fingers, break off golf ball-sized pieces of dough and roll them
between your palms to form a ball. Break each ball in half and press the two
pieces back together so the jagged inside edges are now on top and bottom - but
don't flatten out the dough balls when you press the two halves back
together. The resulting balls should have an irregular, almost hourglass-like
shape.

Place the balls on a baking sheet, at least 1 inch apart, in staggered rows of 3
and 2. If you'd like, you may sprinkle the tops of the cookies with additional
coarse salt. Bake for 10 min or until just slightly underdone (cookies should be
puffed and golden but not brown around the edges or bottoms and they should
appear soft). Immediately bang the baking sheet against the stovetop or a
counter, so that the cookies deflate slightly (this will keep them fresh
longer). Remove the cookies from the baking sheet as soon as possible and cool
on a wire rack.
