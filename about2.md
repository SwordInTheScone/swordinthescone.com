<p>
Welcome to The Sword in the Scone!
</p><p>

As a kid, I was always frustrated by my mother's (understandable) reluctance to
make  cakes in the shape of flying dragons for my birthdays -- no matter how many
hours she  was willing to spend hand-making elaborate invitations, she could
never quite understand  my vision when it came to cake, which, in hindsight, was
likely related to a level of  practicality that comes with the understanding of
basic physics.
</p><p>

Once I stopped being terrified that my oven was going to set the house on fire
(a  comically recent development) I took matters into my own hands and started
baking for  friends' birthday parties, gingerbread house competitions and as an
excuse to put off my  then-homework. A heady mixture of youthful invincibility,
a deep love of sci-fi, fantasy,  and frosting, as well as an overwhelming desire
to prove other people wrong fueled  these delicious adventures. Out of the
overlap between an intensive unit on the Arthurian  Legend and an obsessive
scone-baking phase, The Sword in the Scone was forged.
</p><p>
Based in that most mythical and magical of New York spaces -- an eat-in kitchen --
The Sword in the Scone makes fantasy reality. My promise to you is that if you
can think  it, I can bake it. Hobbit cupcakes? Done. Wall-e cake? Mastered that
years ago. Flying  dragon cake of my childhood dreams? Check. Armed with an art
history degree, an  alarming talent for Lord of the Rings Trivial Pursuit and a
circa 1970 stand mixer I invite  you to challenge me with your own whimsical
ideas.
